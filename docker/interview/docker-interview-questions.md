# Docker Interview Questions

This document contains a list of Docker interview questions ranging from junior to senior levels.

## Junior Developer Questions

1.  **What is Docker?**
    *   Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

2.  **What is a container?**
    *   A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application.

3.  **What is an image?**
    *   A Docker image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. An image is built from a `Dockerfile`.

4.  **What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine (VM)?**
    *   **VMs** virtualize the hardware, meaning they have a full OS installed. They are slower to start and more resource-intensive.
    *   **Containers** virtualize the operating system. They share the host OS kernel and are more lightweight, faster to start, and more portable.

5.  **What is a `Dockerfile`?**
    *   A `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. `docker build` uses this file to build a new image.

6.  **What is Docker Hub?**
    *   Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows you to link to code repositories, build your images and test them, stores manually pushed images, and links to Docker Cloud so you can deploy images to your hosts.

## Mid-level Developer Questions

1.  **What is a Docker volume?**
    *   Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are managed by Docker and are isolated from the host machine's file system.

2.  **What is Docker Compose?**
    *   Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

3.  **Explain Docker networking.**
    *   Docker has several network drivers:
        *   **`bridge`**: The default network driver. If you don't specify a driver, this is the type of network you are creating. Bridge networks are usually used when your applications run in standalone containers that need to communicate.
        *   **`host`**: For standalone containers, this removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host, and uses the host's networking directly.
        *   **`overlay`**: Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together and enable swarm services to communicate with each other.
        *   **`none`**: This driver disables all networking.

4.  **What is the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in a Dockerfile?**
    *   **`ENTRYPOINT`**: Configures a container that will run as an executable. The command-line arguments to `docker run <image>` will be appended after all elements in an `exec` form `ENTRYPOINT`.
    *   **`CMD`**: Provides defaults for an executing container. These defaults can include an executable, or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an `ENTRYPOINT` instruction as well. If you provide arguments to `docker run`, they will override the default specified by `CMD`.

5.  **What are multi-stage builds?**
    *   Multi-stage builds are a feature that allows you to use multiple `FROM` statements in your `Dockerfile`. Each `FROM` instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't want in the final image. This is a great way to create smaller, more secure production images.

6.  **How do you manage secrets in Docker?**
    *   Docker provides a way to manage secrets using `docker secret`. Secrets are encrypted and can be mounted into containers. For Docker Compose, you can define secrets in the `docker-compose.yml` file. For more advanced use cases, tools like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret managers are often used.

## Senior Developer Questions

1.  **What is Docker Swarm?**
    *   Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool, meaning that it allows the user to manage multiple containers deployed across multiple host machines. It provides features like clustering, scheduling, and service discovery.

2.  **How do you optimize Docker image size?**
    *   Discuss strategies like:
        *   Using a smaller base image (e.g., `alpine`).
        *   Using multi-stage builds.
        *   Combining `RUN` commands to reduce the number of layers.
        *   Cleaning up temporary files and caches in the same `RUN` layer.
        *   Using a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.

3.  **What are some Docker security best practices?**
    *   Discuss topics like:
        *   Using minimal base images.
        *   Running containers as a non-root user.
        *   Using a tool to scan images for vulnerabilities (e.g., `docker scan`, Snyk, Trivy).
        *   Managing secrets properly.
        *   Limiting container capabilities.
        *   Using read-only filesystems where possible.

4.  **Explain the Docker architecture.**
    *   Docker uses a client-server architecture.
        *   **The Docker daemon (`dockerd`)**: Listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
        *   **The Docker client (`docker`)**: The primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as `docker run`, the client sends these commands to `dockerd`, which carries them out.
        *   **A Docker registry**: Stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default.

5.  **What is a container orchestration tool? Compare Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.**
    *   A container orchestration tool is used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    *   **Docker Swarm**: Easier to set up and use, tightly integrated with the Docker ecosystem. Good for simpler applications.
    *   **Kubernetes**: More complex but also more powerful and flexible. It has a larger community and has become the industry standard for container orchestration. It offers more advanced features for networking, storage, and self-healing.

6.  **How do you handle logging for containers?**
    *   Docker provides logging drivers that can be configured to send container logs to different destinations. The default is the `json-file` driver, which stores logs on the host filesystem. For production, it's common to use a centralized logging solution like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud-based service (like AWS CloudWatch Logs, Splunk, or Datadog). You can configure the Docker daemon to use a specific logging driver or specify it per container.
