## Context-Specific Vietnamese Developer Considerations

### Common Challenges to Assess
1. **Pronunciation**: Vietnamese speakers often struggle with:
   - Final consonant sounds (worked, tested, cached)
   - "L" vs "R" sounds
   - Vowel distinctions (sheet/shit, live/leave)

2. **Grammar Issues**:
   - Articles (a, an, the)
   - Verb tenses (especially perfect tenses)
   - Pluralization

3. **Cultural Communication Patterns**:
   - Indirectness vs. directness
   - Comfort with disagreement/debate
   - Asking clarifying questions

### Adjustment Tips
- Be patient with pronunciation; focus on comprehensibility over perfection
- Encourage candidates to ask for clarification
- Provide context for idiomatic expressions
- Assess willingness to communicate, not just accuracy

---

## Red Flags

- Cannot understand or respond to basic technical questions in English
- Relies heavily on memorized phrases without comprehension
- Cannot explain their own code or projects
- Becomes frustrated or shuts down when asked to elaborate
- Cannot understand spoken English at normal pace (with clear articulation)

## Green Flags

- Asks for clarification when needed (shows confidence)
- Self-corrects errors naturally
- Uses technical vocabulary appropriately
- Can explain concepts in multiple ways
- Shows enthusiasm to communicate despite imperfections
- Can adapt communication style to audience

---

## Additional Resources for Assessors

### Useful Questions for All Levels
- "Can you explain that in a different way?"
- "What would you do if...?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "How would you explain this to a non-technical person?"

### Follow-up Techniques
- Ask "why" and "how" questions to assess depth
- Request comparisons between technologies/approaches
- Present hypothetical scenarios
- Ask about past experiences in detail

---

## Notes
- Adjust questions based on candidate's actual level
- Focus on communication effectiveness for job requirements
- Consider team environment (remote, international clients, etc.)
- Balance technical accuracy with English proficiency assessment
- Remember: Perfect English is rarely required; effective communication is the goal
